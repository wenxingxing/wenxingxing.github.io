I used to think sleeping is a waste of time, but sleeping is just as productive and important as we do throughout the day.

> If you are going to be successfull, you got be willing to give up sleep. -Eric Thomas, from his [speech](https://youtu.be/6vuetQSwFW8?t=194)

I watched this video while I was in school, and really thought he was right. I slept only 2 hours before our final match in RoboCup, but lose by mis-spelling a variable in our python script and our robots just hangs because the python runtime keeps throwing exception because of `undefine variable`. It was largely because I was too sleepy that day.

TL;DR, notes on this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0fp7kB2vuU)

## Why sleep is important

notebook (temporal storage) - hippocampus

There are 3 different types of sleep:
- REM: making connections between different informations, it's when all the bi-directional connection happens
- LIGHT: before wakeup, helps clean up space for short-term memory
- DEEP: happen right after we fall asleep, helps turn short-term memory into long-term memory

so we just can't sleep too late, neither wake up too early, beacuse
- Sleep too late, missing **DEEP** sleep, not properly storing the hard-earned notes that collected that day	
- Wakeup too early, no room for new info


In short:

- **DEEP** => Save info
- **LIGHT** => Make space for new info
- **REM** => Understand info

## How do we sleep better

1. body needs to drop temperature, so sleep in a cool environment
2. take a hot shower 2 hours before sleep
3. get as much light safely in the morning in the day, because when light hits our eyeball, there are certain chemical recations, that kinda resets our *circadian rhythm*

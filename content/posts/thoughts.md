Consciousness, cognition and memory are the most precious resources for human beings. But most of us waste them unconsciously, without knowing that they are not infinite resources, they are bounded by our life, or time.

That I'm writing this post using visual studio code, hhkb keyboard, viewing on a aoc monitor with a x86 computer running an intel 12th-gen i7 cpu, all of this is a miracle. But most of the time, we didn't recognize it.
And most of the time, we're living in such a unconscious manner...
